This is my first full CRUD application. It is also an exercise in webpack, prettier, ES6 modules, and writing code in a module pattern. 

NOTE: due to Git issues, the original version was lost. This version was originally uploaded on April 9th 2022.

FURTHER CHANGES
1. Fix the delete button hover bug 
2. Some "today" projects appear in the "inbox" and vice versa - fix this bug
3. Add cloud storage
